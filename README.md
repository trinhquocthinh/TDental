# Dentelo Dental Clinic – Next.js Rebuild

Modernized version of the Dentelo clinic marketing site, migrated from static HTML to **Next.js 14** with **TypeScript** and **SCSS**. The App Router, data-driven components, and reusable design system keep content easy to maintain while preserving the original brand look and feel.

## 🚀 What’s Shipped

- App Router layout with shared header, footer, appointment modal, and global fonts
- Fully converted pages: **Home**, **Services**, **About**, **Blog**, **Contact**
- Centralized data modules for hero content, services, doctors, blog articles, FAQs, and contact channels
- Accessible modals and forms (`BookAppointmentButton`, `ContactForm`, `NewsletterSignup`)
- SEO-friendly metadata exports per page plus `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts`
- SCSS variables, mixins, and global styles mirroring the legacy design system

## 🧭 Page Highlights

| Route | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Data-driven hero, services, doctors, testimonials, blog teaser, CTA |
| `/services` | Detailed services grid, patient stories, FAQ section, appointment CTA |
| `/about` | Mission, care principles, team spotlight with social links |
| `/blog` | Article listing sourced from `src/data/blog.ts`, calendar badges, newsletter signup |
| `/contact` | Clinic info, embedded map, validated contact form, FAQs, consultation CTA |

All internal links use `next/link`, and hero/background media leverage `next/image` for optimization.

## �️ Getting Started

```bash
npm install      # or yarn install
npm run dev      # start local dev server on http://localhost:3000

npm run build    # production build
npm start        # serve production build
npm run lint     # lint with ESLint & Prettier rules
```

No additional environment variables are required for local development. Optional fields (analytics, APIs) can be added via `.env.local` as the project evolves.

## 🧩 Notable Components & Data Modules

- `BookAppointmentButton` – opens the global appointment modal exposed by the context provider
- `ContactForm` – client-side validation with inline feedback, dropdowns sourced from `src/data/contact.ts`
- `NewsletterSignup` – lightweight form with basic email validation and accessible status messaging
- `contactFaqs`, `blogArticles`, `services` – keep content structured and reusable across pages

## 🔍 Quality Checks

- `npm run lint` – validates formatting and accessibility rules enforced by ESLint/Prettier
- Images live under `public/assets/images` and are referenced with absolute `/assets/...` paths for compatibility with Next Image

## � Suggested Next Enhancements

- Wire the contact and newsletter forms to a real submission endpoint or service
- Emit JSON-LD schemas (FAQ, LocalBusiness, Article) for richer search results
- Consolidate home-page blog teasers to reuse the `blogArticles` data source
- Add analytics or session recording via a lightweight provider in `layout.tsx`
